# Adult Rat NAc
This repository contains R code for analysis of single nucleus RNA-sequencing datasets from the adult rat NAc and for analysis of RNAscope imaging data. 

# Study design
A previously published snRNA-seq dataset  from [_A dopamine-induced gene expression signature regulates neuronal function and cocaine response_](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/26/eaba4221) was integrated with a novel dataset containing NAc nuclei from male and female Sprague-dawley rats that were injected with seven consecutive doses of saline or cocaine. Overall, this dataset contains samples from two separate experiments and eight experimental groups: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Acute** - Rats received a single dose of saline or cocaine

1. Male adult rats, 1hr following first saline injection
2. Male adult rats, 1hr following first cocaine injection (20mg/kg, I.P.)
3. Female adult rats, 1hr following first saline injection
4. Female adult rats, 1hr following first cocaine injection (20mg/kg, I.P.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Repeated** - Rats received seven consecutive doses of saline or cocaine

5. Male adult rats, 1hr following seventh saline injection
6. Male adult rats, 1hr following seventh cocaine injection (20mg/kg, I.P.)
7. Female adult rats, 1hr following seventh saline injection
8. Female adult rats, 1hr following seventh cocaine injection (20mg/kg, I.P.)
